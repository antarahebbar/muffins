# Muffins Mini Package

### **Muffins.jl** is a Julia mini package for solving the **Muffin Problem**:

## The problem:

Given m muffins and s students, divide the muffins in such a way that all students can receive equal amounts of muffin.
Determine muffins(m, s), the largest possible minimum muffin piece cut

The Muffin Problem was first proposed by Alan Frank in 2011. Algorithms and solution methods were later extensively developed in The Muffin Book (2019), a collaboration between William Gasarch, Erik Metz, Jacob Prinz, and Daniel Smolyak among others.

The theorems and conjectures referenced by Muffins.jl are expanded upon and proven on the Muffin Website and in The Muffin Book.
